**********************************************************************

I migrated the source for this project from Sourceforge for historical
purposes. It has not been updated in 15 years and almost certainly does
not compile for current KDE.

Katy v0.3.1
Gordon Tyler <gordon@doxxx.net>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is Katy, a KDE text editor with all the features that you would know and
love if you have used UltraEdit in Windows.

Please read INSTALL for instructions on how to install Katy.

Katy has a SourceForge project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/katy

Please consult the SourceForge project for list of features to be implemented
in the future. Please feel free to suggest extra features, however I cannot
give any guarantee that they will be impemented. But I can try ;)

If you feel the urge to implement some of these features, please contact me
so that I can co-ordinate our efforts (in case somebody else is already
working on that particular feature). It would be preferrable if you were a
registered SourceForge developer.
